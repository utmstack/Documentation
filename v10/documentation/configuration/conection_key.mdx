### Install Agents

- **Purpose**: The Connection Key is utilized as a panel token that is integrated within the agent installation command line. This token ensures that the agent is authenticated and allowed to communicate with the central panel, thereby maintaining a secure environment.

- **Process**: When installing agents on target machines or devices, the Connection Key is included in the command line instructions to successfully authenticate and link the agents to the central panel.

### Connect with Federation Service

- **Purpose**: This key also enables the management of the UTMStack instance through a Federation Service, specifically for the purpose of multitenancy. This is essential for environments where multiple separate entities or administrative domains require access to the system.

- **Process**: The Connection Key facilitates secure connection to a Federation Service, ensuring that all federated instances are properly managed and maintained within a centralized framework.


<Tip>
    **Security Tip**: To maintain the security integrity of your Connection Key, it’s vital to change it regularly and immediately if there is any suspicion of compromise. Avoid sharing the key with untrusted parties.

### Generating a New Connection Key

- If you need to generate a new Connection Key, you can do so easily by clicking the `Generate new connection key` button. This action will create a new, unique key to replace the old one and will require updating the key across all deployed agents and services that use it.

<Warning>
    Always ensure that the new key is distributed securely and updated in all configurations to prevent service disruption.
