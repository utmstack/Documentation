# Index Patterns Management

*This interface simplifies the process of managing which indices are analyzed and visualized in the system.*

## Index Patterns Management

- **Pattern**: This column lists the pattern used to match against multiple index names.
- **Used by Integration**: Indicates the integration from which the logs are generated.
- **Action**: Allows the user to perform actions such as editing or deleting the index patterns (only when it's not been used for the integration).

Examples of patterns and their uses:

- `log-*` - Matches all indices that start with `log-`.
- `alert-*` - Matches all indices that start with `alert-`.
- `log-wineventlog-*` - Used for indices related to Windows event logs.
- `log-o365-*` - Used for Office 365 logs.
- `log-firewall-*` - Matches indices for various firewall logs.


> **Note:** The user can also create new index patterns to match their indexing needs by using the "Create index pattern" button.
