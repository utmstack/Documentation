## Managing Indices


> To **delete an index**, click on the delete action (❌) next to the index you wish to remove. Be cautious as this action is irreversible.

## Searching Within an Index

Use the search bar at the top of the index table to filter and search for specific indices.


> **Note:** The indices are automatically named based on the date and type of logs they contain.



> **Note:** The status `open` indicates that the index is active and can be written to or searched.

    

> **💡 Tip:** **Tip:** Regularly monitor the size and document count of your indices to ensure optimal performance and storage management.
