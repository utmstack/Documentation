### Step 1. **Purchase a License** 
   - Visit the UTMStack pricing page at [UTMStack Pricing](https://utmstack.com/pricing/) to select and purchase a license that fits your organizational needs.
   
### Step 2. **Activate Your License**
   - Once you have purchased a license, you will receive a **License ID**.
   - Enter the License ID in the designated field on the UTMStack configuration page.
   - Click the '**Activate**' button to verify and apply your license.

## Post-Activation

After activating your license, you should receive confirmation that your paid license is active. The License section will then be updated with the following details:

- **Activation:** Reflects the status as 'Activated.'
- **Expiration:** Displays the expiry date of your current license.

Remember to renew your license before the expiration date to ensure uninterrupted service and support.
