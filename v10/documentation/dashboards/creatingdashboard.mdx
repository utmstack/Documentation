This is the Visualization Menu, where you can see and add new visualizations to your dashboard.

This has the following parts:

* **Filter Visualizations**
Before adding visualizations to your dashboard, you may want to filter them based on specific criteria:

    * **Visualization Name**: If you know the name of the visualization you want, input it here.
    * **Chart Type**: If you're interested in specific chart types (e.g., bar, pie, line), filter by this category.
    * **Source**: If your visualization depends on a specific data source, use this filter.

    These filters help you quickly find the exact visualizations you need.

* **Visualizations List**
Review the list of visualizations based on your filtered criteria. Choose the visualizations you want to include in your dashboard. Remember, you can select multiple visualizations to provide various data views.

* **Add Visualizations**
Click the Add Visualizations button to add the selected visualizations to your dashboard. You will then be directed to the dashboard editor.

* **Create New Visualization**
If you need a custom visualization that's not in the list, use the New Visualization button. This action will open the Visualization Editor, where you can create a custom visualization from scratch.

* **Configure and Save Dashboard**
In the dashboard editor, you can arrange, resize, and modify the visualizations as needed. Once you're satisfied with the layout, give your dashboard a unique name, an optional description, and save it for future use.

By following these steps, you can create custom, insightful dashboards to analyze and visualize your data effectively with UTMStack.

Each visualization on your dashboard comes with a set of options:

### 1. **Visualization Options**
  * **Edit Visualization**: This option allows you to modify the selected visualization's parameters directly from the dashboard. The visualization builder provides a variety of tools to manipulate your data for more accurate representation.

  * **Edit Panel**: This option lets you change the name of the visualization panel. An appropriate name can make it easier to understand the visualization's purpose at a glance.

  * **Disable/Enable Time Filter**: This option lets you enable or disable the time filter for the specific visualization. It can be helpful when you need a visualization to display data from a different time range than the dashboard's global time filter.
  
### 2. **Delete Visualization**
The delete option allows you to remove any unwanted visualization from your dashboard.
<Note>
    **Resize and Reposition Visualizations**
    Each visualization in your dashboard can be resized and repositioned to best fit your needs. Click and drag the lower right corner of a visualization to resize it, or click and drag the visualization's title bar to reposition it.

**Add Filter**
Use the Add Filter option to narrow down the data displayed in your visualizations. This can be particularly useful when you want to filter specific fields of your datasource.
