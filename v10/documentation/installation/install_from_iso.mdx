   ```bash
   $ sudo su
```
   [enter password for utmstack]
   ```
   # tail -f /home/utmstack/installer.log
```

2. After confirming that the installation has completed successfully, open a web browser on your computer or virtual machine.

3. Enter the IP address obtained from the previous steps into the browser.
