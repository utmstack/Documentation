## Introduction

Threat Intelligence is a proactive approach to cybersecurity that involves gathering, analyzing, and applying information about potential and current cyber threats. It provides organizations with valuable insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors, as well as the vulnerabilities they exploit.

The primary goal of Threat Intelligence is to enhance an organization's ability to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats effectively. By understanding the evolving threat landscape, organizations can make informed decisions about allocating resources, strengthening defenses, and mitigating risks.

Threat Intelligence encompasses a wide range of data sources, including open-source intelligence (OSINT), commercial feeds, internal logs, and collaborative sharing with trusted partners and communities. This diverse set of information is then processed and analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).

Effective Threat Intelligence programs involve not only collecting data but also contextualizing it within the organization's specific environment and business objectives. This contextualization helps prioritize threats based on their relevance and potential impact, allowing security teams to focus their efforts where they are most needed.
