## 1. Install UTMStack


> **Note:** Please refer to the [System Requirements](../Installation/system_requirements) page in the UTMStack documentation for detailed information about the recommended specifications for your environment.


### **Integration Requirements** : 
To ensure optimal system performance, certain additional requirements beyond the minimums must be considered. Each integration being introduced should reserve at least 1GB of space. This reservation is crucial to ensure proper data storage and efficient system operation as a whole.

### **Procedure**:

Use the UTMStack installer for Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS.

- **Download and Prepare**:  
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install wget
    wget http://github.com/utmstack/UTMStack/releases/latest/download/installer
    sudo su
    chmod +x installer
    ```

- **Install**:  
    ```bash
    ./installer
    ```

### **Configure Firewall and Ports**:

Ensure the following ports are correctly configured on your firewall for UTM Stack access:

- **22/TCP**: Secure Shell (Restrict to admin workstation).
- **80/TCP**: Web-based GUI Redirector (Restrict to admin and security analyst workstations).
- **443/TCP**: Web-based GUI (Restrict to admin and security analyst workstations).
- **9090/TCP**: Cockpit Web-based Interface (Restrict to admin workstation).
- **9000/TCP**: Purpose: Agent-to-Master Communication (Required for communication between UTMStack agents and the master server).
- **9001/TCP**: Purpose: Agent-to-Master Communication (Required for communication between UTMStack agents and the master server).
- **50051/TCP**: Purpose: Agent-to-Master Communication (Required for communication between UTMStack agents and the master server).


### Setup SSL with Certbot (Optional, but recommended):
If you haven't manually installed an SSL certificate, use Certbot to generate one for your domain. This ensures encrypted connections for your users.


> **💡 Tip:** Follow the provided guide: [Generate SSL with Certbot](../Installation/ssl_certificate).


## 2. Initial Configuration

Post installation, the first time you get access to UTMStack, its going to be required that enter the old password and establish the new one.The default username is `admin`. Your initial password and other configurations can be found in `/root/utmstack.yml`.
