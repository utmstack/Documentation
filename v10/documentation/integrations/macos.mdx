# Integration guide for MacOS

*The macOS agent collects system and application logs, monitors activity, and communicates securely with the UTMStack master server or proxy. It also enables incident response actions.*

> **Note:** This feature is part of a **paid subscription**. Please contact our support team to obtain the required installation dependencies.


## Installation Steps


### 1. Configure your device to send logs to a UTMStack agent on ports:
        * 9000 
        * 9001
        * 50051

### 2. Contact Support.


> **Note:** Reach out to UTMStack support to request the **macOS installation dependencies**. These files are necessary to perform installation or uninstallation of the agent.


### 3. Run the Corresponding Command


> **💡 Tip:** Depending on whether you want to **install** or **uninstall** the agent, use the appropriate command provided in your UTMStack instance:



> **⚠️ Warning:** These commands must be copied **directly from your UTMStack instance**, under the **Integrations** section, to ensure the correct configuration.


```bash
# Example (replace with actual command from instance)
sudo ./utmstack-macos-installer install
# or
sudo ./utmstack-macos-installer uninstall
```
