## Installing Linux agent


> **Note:** The Linux agent captures system and application logs and sends them to a UTMStack master server or probe/proxy, monitors system activity, and executes incident response commands. The UTMStack agents communicate over ports 9000 and 50051. Please make sure these ports are open.


### 1. Install or uninstall the UTMStack agent according to your operating system:

> **Note:** The following commands contains sensitive information, don't share it.



> **⚠️ Warning:** Agent installation commands for operating systems **must be copied directly from your UTMStack instance**, under the **Integrations** section.  
    This ensures that all tokens, identifiers, and configuration parameters are accurate and specific to your environment.


### 2. Run the command in the console

#### Example:

<img

  alt="Linux Agent"
