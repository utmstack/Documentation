## Installing FortiGate


> **⚠️ Warning:** This integration requires a UTMStack agent to work properly. Please, make sure you have installed it before you continue.


> This integration relies on Syslog. Logs received via Syslog are parsed and correlated by UTMStack automatically.


### 1. Configure your device to send logs to a UTMStack agent on ports:
        * 7005 TCP
        * 7005 UDP

### 2. Enable log collector.


> **Note:** To enable the log collector where you have the UTMStack agent installed, follow the instructions below based on your operating system and preferred protocol.



> **💡 Tip:** Execute command according to the selected platform



> **⚠️ Warning:** Agent installation commands for operating systems **must be copied directly from your UTMStack instance**, under the **Integrations** section.  
    This ensures that all tokens, identifiers, and configuration parameters are accurate and specific to your environment.
