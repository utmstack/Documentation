## Overview

Welcome to the UTMStack open-source project! UTMStack is a unified threat management platform that merges **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) and **XDR** (Extended Detection and Response) technologies. Our unique approach allows real-time correlation of log data, threat intelligence, and malware activity patterns from multiple sources, enabling the identification and halting of complex threats that use stealthy techniques.
