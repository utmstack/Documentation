## Hardware Resources

The following specifications are based on typical deployment scenarios. Resource requirements scale with the number of data sources and data volume.

### Definitions

<Accordion multiple={true}>
  <AccordionTab title="Hot Log Storage" icon="pi pi-server">

    Non-archived data that can be accessed for analysis at any time. This is the actively indexed data in Elasticsearch.

  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab title="Cold Log Storage" icon="pi pi-database">

    Archived data that must be restored before accessing it. Used for long-term compliance and historical analysis.

  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab title="Data Source" icon="fa fa-laptop">

    Any individual source of logs, including devices, agents, SaaS integrations, network equipment, servers, and applications.

  </AccordionTab>

</Accordion>

### Baseline Assumptions

- **60 data sources** generate approximately **100 GB** of monthly data
- Specifications below are for **one month of hot log storage**

### Resource Tiers

<Columns columnCount={2}>
  <Column>
    <Card title="Small Deployment" icon="pi pi-building">
    
    **50 data sources (120 GB/month)**
    
    - CPU: 4 Cores
    - RAM: 16 GB
    - Disk: 150 GB SSD
    - Ideal for: Small businesses, branch offices
    
    </Card>
    <Card title="Large Deployment" icon="pi pi-building-columns">
    
    **240 data sources (500 GB/month)**
    
    - CPU: 16 Cores
    - RAM: 32 GB
    - Disk: 500 GB SSD
    - Ideal for: Enterprises, MSPs
    
    </Card>
  </Column>
  <Column>
    <Card title="Medium Deployment" icon="pi pi-server">
    
    **120 data sources (250 GB/month)**
    
    - CPU: 8 Cores
    - RAM: 16 GB
    - Disk: 250 GB SSD
    - Ideal for: Mid-size organizations
    
    </Card>
    <Card title="Enterprise Deployment" icon="pi pi-globe">
    
    **500 data sources (1 TB/month)**
    
    - CPU: 32 Cores
    - RAM: 64 GB
    - Disk: 1 TB SSD
    - Ideal for: Large enterprises
    
    </Card>
  </Column>
</Columns>

> [!WARNING]
> **Horizontal Scaling Required**: Deployments exceeding 500 data sources require adding secondary worker nodes for horizontal scaling. See the [Architecture](/v11/Installation/architecture) guide for multi-node deployment patterns.

### Combining Resource Tiers

You may combine these tiers to allocate resources based on:

- Number of devices and data sources
- Desired hot log storage retention period
- Expected log volume and ingestion rate
- Analysis and query performance requirements

**Example**: If you need 6 months of hot storage for 120 data sources:

- Base: 8 Cores, 16 GB RAM, 250 GB Disk
- Multiply storage by 6: **1.5 TB Disk**
- Consider increasing RAM to 32 GB for better query performance

## Network Requirements

### Required Ports

The following ports must be accessible for UTMStack to function properly:

<Accordion multiple={true}>
  <AccordionTab title="22/TCP - SSH (Secure Shell)" icon="fa fa-terminal">

    **Purpose**: Server administration and management  
    **Security Recommendation**:
    - Create a firewall rule to allow access only from administrator workstations
    - Use key-based authentication
    - Disable password authentication
    - Consider changing the default port

  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab title="80/TCP - HTTP Redirect" icon="fa fa-exchange">

    **Purpose**: Web interface HTTP redirector to HTTPS  
    **Security Recommendation**:
    - Allow access only from admin and security analyst workstations
    - Automatically redirects to HTTPS (port 443)

  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab title="443/TCP - HTTPS" icon="fa fa-lock">

    **Purpose**: UTMStack web-based graphical user interface  
    **Security Recommendation**:
    - Allow access only from admin and security analyst workstations
    - Use valid SSL/TLS certificates
    - Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab title="9090/TCP - Cockpit" icon="pi pi-clock">

    **Purpose**: Web-based graphical interface for server management  
    **Security Recommendation**:
    - Restrict access to administrator workstations only
    - Consider disabling if not used

  </AccordionTab>

</Accordion>

### Integration Ports

> [!INFO]
> Additional ports will be required during the configuration of UTMStack integrations to receive logs from various data sources.  
> These ports vary by integration type (syslog, agents, APIs, etc.). Please follow the security recommendations provided in each specific integration guide.

Common integration ports include:

- **514/UDP & 514/TCP**: Syslog
- **6514/TCP**: Syslog over TLS
- **5044/TCP**: Beats protocol (for agents)
- **9200/TCP**: Elasticsearch (internal cluster communication)
- **Various**: API endpoints for cloud integrations
---
## Storage Recommendations

### Disk Type

- **SSD strongly recommended** for Elasticsearch data
- NVMe SSDs provide optimal performance for high-volume deployments
- Standard HDDs acceptable only for cold storage archives

### Filesystem

- **ext4** or **XFS** recommended
- Disable `atime` updates for better performance
- Consider separate volumes for:
    - System (`/`)
  - Docker (`/var/lib/docker`)
  - UTMStack data (`/opt/utmstack` or custom path)

### IOPS Considerations

- Minimum 3,000 IOPS for small deployments
- 10,000+ IOPS recommended for large deployments
- Monitor disk I/O and scale accordingly
---
## Network Bandwidth

### Minimum Requirements

- **100 Mbps** for small deployments (up to 50 sources)
- **1 Gbps** for medium to large deployments
- **10 Gbps** for enterprise deployments with 500+ sources

### Considerations

- Factor in peak ingestion rates
- Account for user access and dashboard queries
- Consider bandwidth for backup and data replication
---
## Browser Compatibility

UTMStack v11 web interface is compatible with:

- **Google Chrome** (recommended) - Latest 2 versions
- **Mozilla Firefox** - Latest 2 versions
- **Microsoft Edge** (Chromium-based) - Latest 2 versions
- **Safari** - Latest 2 versions

> [!WARNING]
> Internet Explorer is not supported. JavaScript must be enabled.
---
## Additional Considerations

### Virtualization

UTMStack can run on:

- VMware ESXi
- Proxmox VE
- KVM/QEMU
- Microsoft Hyper-V
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure CPU cores are dedicated (not overcommitted) for production deployments.

### Time Synchronization

- **NTP/Chrony** must be configured and synchronized
- Critical for accurate log correlation and timestamp analysis
- All nodes in a multi-node deployment must be time-synchronized

### DNS Resolution

- Proper DNS configuration required for hostname resolution
- Forward and reverse DNS should be correctly configured
- Important for multi-node deployments and integrations
