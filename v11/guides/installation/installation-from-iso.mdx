## Installation Flow

The installation process is designed to be straightforward with minimal user input required:

  ### Download the ISO

    Download the UTMStack v11 Community Edition ISO:
    
    [**Download utmstack-v11-autoinstall.iso**](https://cdn.utmstack.com/iso/utmstack-v11-autoinstall.iso)
    
    Save the ISO file to a location accessible to your virtualization platform.
  ### Attach ISO and Boot

    Attach the UTMStack ISO to your virtual machine and boot from it. The automated installer will launch automatically.
  ### Create User Credentials

    During installation, you will be prompted to:
    - Create a **username** (no default credentials exist)
    - Set a **strong password**
    
    <Warning>
    Store these credentials securely - they are required for all future system access.
    </Warning>
  ### Configure Network Settings

    Choose your network configuration:
    - **DHCP** (automatic IP assignment)
    - **Static IP** (manual configuration)
    
    Ensure your network settings allow outbound connectivity for package downloads.
  ### Automatic Package Installation

    The system automatically installs essential packages:
    - `openssh-server` - Remote SSH access
    - `curl`, `wget` - Network utilities
    - `git` - Version control
    - `vim` - Text editor
    - `htop` - Process monitor
    - `net-tools` - Network utilities
  ### First Boot Configuration

    On first boot, the following occurs automatically:
    - UTMStack installer launches
    - Custom MOTD with UTMStack branding displays
    - Installation logs begin writing to `/var/log/utmstack/`
<Info>
The entire installation process typically takes 15-30 minutes depending on hardware and network speed.
</Info>

---

## Post-Installation Steps

### 1. Log In

Once installation completes, log in using the credentials you created during the setup process.

```bash
# Login via console or SSH
ssh username@your-server-ip
```

<Note>
SSH is enabled by default and ready for remote access immediately after installation.
</Note>

---

### 2. Monitor Installer Progress

The UTMStack installer runs automatically on first boot. Monitor its progress:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Follow Installation Log (Real-time)
tail -f /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
```

```bash View Recent Log Entries
tail -n 50 /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
```

```bash View Complete Installation Log
cat /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
```

```bash Search for Errors
grep -i error /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Keep the log monitoring terminal open during installation to catch any potential issues in real-time.
</Tip>

---

### 3. Optional Setup Wizard

After the main installation completes, you can run the setup wizard to configure additional settings:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Using Symlink (Recommended)
utmstack-setup
```

```bash Direct Script Execution
sudo /opt/utmstack/finish-install-setup.sh
```
</CodeGroup>

<Accordion multiple={true}>
    <AccordionTab header="What does the setup wizard configure?">

    The setup wizard currently handles:
    - **Timezone configuration** - Set your local timezone
    
    **Note**: The hostname is already configured during the initial installation process and does not need to be set again.
  
  </AccordionTab>
</Accordion>

---

### 4. System Verification

After installation, verify your system is configured correctly:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Check Ubuntu Version
lsb_release -a
# Expected: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
```

```bash Check Network Configuration
ip addr show
# Verify your IP address and network interfaces
```

```bash Check SSH Status
sudo systemctl status ssh
# Should show: active (running)
```

```bash Check Installer Status
ps aux | grep utmstack
# Shows if installer is still running
```

```bash Check Docker Status
sudo docker ps
# Lists running UTMStack containers
```

```bash Check System Resources
htop
# Monitor CPU, RAM, and process usage
```
</CodeGroup>

---

## Installed Scripts and Symlinks

All UTMStack scripts are centrally located for easy management and access.

### Script Location

**Primary Directory**: `/opt/utmstack/`

<Accordion multiple={true}>
    <AccordionTab header="start.sh">

    **Purpose**: Main UTMStack installer launcher
    
    **Execution**: Runs automatically on first boot
    
    **Manual Run**: 
    ```bash
    sudo /opt/utmstack/start.sh
    ```
  
  </AccordionTab>

    <AccordionTab header="finish-install-setup.sh">

    **Purpose**: Post-installation setup wizard (timezone configuration)
    
    **Execution**: Optional, run manually after installation
    
    **Symlink**: `utmstack-setup`
  
  </AccordionTab>
</Accordion>

### Convenient Symlinks

For quick access, symlinks are created under `/usr/local/bin/`:

```bash
utmstack-install  → /opt/utmstack/start.sh
utmstack-setup    → /opt/utmstack/finish-install-setup.sh
```

<Tip>
You can run these commands from any directory without specifying the full path.
</Tip>

## Log Files

All installation and system logs are centralized for easy troubleshooting.

### Log Location

**Primary Log Directory**: `/var/log/utmstack/`

| Log File | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `installer.log` | Main installation process log |
| Additional logs | Created by UTMStack services as they start |

<CodeGroup>
```bash View Installer Log
sudo cat /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
```

```bash Monitor Log in Real-time
sudo tail -f /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
```

```bash List All UTMStack Logs
ls -lh /var/log/utmstack/
```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion multiple={true}>
    <AccordionTab header="Installation appears stuck">

    **Solution**:
    1. Check the installer log for errors:
       ```bash
       tail -f /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
       ```
    2. Verify network connectivity:
       ```bash
       ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
       ```
    3. Check if the installer process is running:
       ```bash
       ps aux | grep utmstack
       ```
  
  </AccordionTab>

    <AccordionTab header="Cannot connect via SSH">

    **Solution**:
    1. Verify SSH service is running:
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl status ssh
       ```
    2. Check firewall rules:
       ```bash
       sudo ufw status
       ```
    3. Verify network configuration:
       ```bash
       ip addr show
       ```
  
  </AccordionTab>

    <AccordionTab header="Installer failed with errors">

    **Solution**:
    1. Review the complete log:
       ```bash
       cat /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
       ```
    2. Check for specific error messages
    3. Verify system resources meet requirements
    4. Contact support with log file if issue persists
  
  </AccordionTab>

    <AccordionTab header="Need to re-run the installer">

    **Solution**:
    ```bash
    sudo /opt/utmstack/start.sh
    ```
    
    <Warning>
    Re-running the installer may reset existing configurations. Backup any custom settings first.
    </Warning>
  
  </AccordionTab>

## Security Considerations

<Card title="Basic Security Hardening Included" icon="pi pi-shield" iconAlign="left" content="The ISO includes basic security hardening measures:      - No default credentials (user creates during installation)   - SSH configured with secure defaults   - Minimal exposed services   - System updates applied during installation" />

### Post-Installation Security Recommendations

  ### Configure Firewall

    Set up UFW firewall rules to restrict access. See [Firewall Rules](/v11/Installation/firewall_rules) for detailed configuration.
  ### Enable SSL/TLS

    Configure SSL certificates for secure web access. See [SSL Certificate](/v11/Installation/ssl_certificate) for instructions.
  ### Update System

    Keep your system updated with the latest security patches:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
  ### Harden SSH

    - Disable password authentication (use keys only)
    - Change default SSH port
    - Restrict SSH access by IP
