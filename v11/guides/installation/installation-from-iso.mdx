  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab title="Step 4: Configure Network Settings" icon="hi-share-outline">

    Choose your network configuration:
    - **DHCP** (automatic IP assignment)
    - **Static IP** (manual configuration)  
    Ensure your network settings allow outbound connectivity for package downloads.

  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab title="Step 5: Automatic Package Installation" icon="fa fa-magic">

  </AccordionTab>

</Accordion>

> [!INFO]

## Post-Installation Steps

### 1. Log In

Once installation completes, log in using the credentials you created during the setup process.

```bash
# Login via console or SSH
ssh username@your-server-ip
```

> [!NOTE]
> SSH is enabled by default and ready for remote access immediately after installation.
---
### 2. Monitor Installer Progress

The UTMStack installer runs automatically on first boot. Monitor its progress:

<CodeGroup>
  <Code lang="javascript">
    tail -f /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
  </Code>
  <Code lang="javascript">
    tail -n 50 /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
  </Code>
  <Code lang="javascript">
    cat /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
  </Code>
  <Code lang="javascript">
    grep -i error /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
  </Code>
</CodeGroup>

> [!TIP]
> Keep the log monitoring terminal open during installation to catch any potential issues in real-time.
---
### 3. Optional Setup Wizard

After the main installation completes, you can run the setup wizard to configure additional settings:

<CodeGroup>
  <Code lang="bash">
    utmstack-setup
  </Code>
  <Code lang="bash">
    sudo /opt/utmstack/finish-install-setup.sh
  </Code>
</CodeGroup>

<Accordion multiple={true}>
  <AccordionTab title="What does the setup wizard configure?" icon="hi-questionMarkCircle-outline">

    The setup wizard currently handles:
    - **Timezone configuration** - Set your local timezone  
    **Note**: The hostname is already configured during the initial installation process and does not need to be set again.

  </AccordionTab>

</Accordion>
---
### 4. System Verification

After installation, verify your system is configured correctly:

<CodeGroup>
  <Code lang="javascript">
    lsb_release -a
    Expected: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
  </Code>
  <Code lang="javascript">
    ip addr show
    Verify your IP address and network interfaces
  </Code>
  <Code lang="javascript">
    sudo systemctl status ssh
    Should show: active (running)
  </Code>
  <Code lang="javascript">
    ps aux | grep utmstack
    Shows if installer is still running
  </Code>
  <Code lang="javascript">
    sudo docker ps
    Lists running UTMStack containers
  </Code>
  <Code lang="javascript">
    htop
    Monitor CPU, RAM, and process usage
  </Code>
</CodeGroup>
---
## Installed Scripts and Symlinks

All UTMStack scripts are centrally located for easy management and access.

### Script Location

**Primary Directory**: `/opt/utmstack/`

<Accordion multiple={true}>
  <AccordionTab title="start.sh" icon="hi-play-solid">

    **Purpose**: Main UTMStack installer launcher  
    **Execution**: Runs automatically on first boot  
    **Manual Run**:

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion multiple={true}>
  <AccordionTab title="Installation appears stuck" icon="fa fa-hourglass">

    **Solution**:
    1. Check the installer log for errors:

      ```
    ```plaintext
    tail -f /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
    ```plaintext
    2. Verify network connectivity:
    ```bash
    ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
    ```
    1. Check if the installer process is running:
        ```bash
      
      ```
    ```plaintext
    ps aux | grep utmstack
    ```plaintext
    
    </AccordionTab>
    
    <AccordionTab title="Cannot connect via SSH" >
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Verify SSH service is running:

      ```
    ```plaintext
    cat /var/log/utmstack/installer.log
    ```plaintext
    2. Check for specific error messages
    3. Verify system resources meet requirements
    4. Contact support with log file if issue persists
    
    </AccordionTab>
    
    <AccordionTab title="Need to re-run the installer" >
    
    **Solution**:
    ```bash
    sudo /opt/utmstack/start.sh
    ```
    > [!WARNING]
    > Re-running the installer may reset existing configurations. Backup any custom settings first.

## Security Considerations

<Card title="Basic Security Hardening Included" icon="pi pi-shield">

The ISO includes basic security hardening measures:

- No default credentials (user creates during installation)
- SSH configured with secure defaults
- Minimal exposed services
- System updates applied during installation

</Card>

### Post-Installation Security Recommendations

### Configure Firewall

Set up UFW firewall rules to restrict access. See [Firewall Rules](/v11/Installation/firewall_rules) for detailed configuration.

### Enable SSL/TLS

Configure SSL certificates for secure web access. See [SSL Certificate](/v11/Installation/ssl_certificate) for instructions.

### Update System

Keep your system updated with the latest security patches:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Harden SSH

- Disable password authentication (use keys only)
- Change default SSH port
- Restrict SSH access by IP
