At its core, Azure is a public cloud computing platform—with solutions including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) that can be used for services such as analytics, virtual computing, storage, networking, and much more.

## Installing Azure

### 1. Create "Event Hub"

> [!NOTE]
> Using the official Azure documentation [Quickstart: Create an event hub using Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create)

### 2. Create a new "Shared access policy" to allow access to the Event Hub created, make sure you select the "Listen" permission.

> [!NOTE]
> Create a new consumer group specifically for Logstash. Do not use the $default or any other consumer group that might already be in use. Reusing consumer groups among non-related consumers can cause unexpected behavior and possibly lost events. All Logstash instances should use the same consumer group so that they can work together for processing events.

### 5. Create a "Storage Account"

> [!NOTE]
> Using the official Azure documentation [Quickstart: Create a storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal)

### 6. Get the "Storage Container Name"

> In: All services -> Storage accounts -> Your_Storage_Account -> Containers. It will be used to configure your tenant.
