## Installing Linux agent

> [!NOTE]
> The Linux agent captures system and application logs and sends them to a UTMStack master server or probe/proxy, monitors system activity, and executes incident response commands. The UTMStack agents communicate over ports 9000 and 50051. Please make sure these ports are open.

## Prerequisite:

> The Linux Agent requires **rsyslog** to be installed and running on the system before installation.  
> Please ensure the `rsyslog` service is installed and enabled.
