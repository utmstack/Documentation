## Installing Linux agent

> [!NOTE]
> The Linux agent captures system and application logs and sends them to a UTMStack master server or probe/proxy, monitors system activity, and executes incident response commands. The UTMStack agents communicate over ports 9000 and 50051. Please make sure these ports are open.

## Prerequisite:

> [!WARNING]
> **Log forwarding requirement:**  
> The Linux Agent relies on **rsyslog** to collect and forward system and application logs to UTMStack.  
> Ensure `rsyslog` is installed and running; otherwise, logs will not be sent to UTMStack.

### 1. Install or uninstall the UTMStack agent according to your operating system:

> Agent installation commands for operating systems **must be copied directly from your UTMStack instance**, under the **Integrations** section.  
> This ensures that all tokens, identifiers, and configuration parameters are accurate and specific to your environment.

### 2. Run the command in the console
