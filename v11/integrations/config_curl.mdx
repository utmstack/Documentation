## Check if You Already Have cURL

You might not need to install anything:

- If you are using **Windows Server 2019** or **Windows 10 version 1803 or later**, `curl` is likely already installed.
- Default path: `C:\Windows\System32\curl.exe`

---

## Manual Installation

### 1. Download and Extract 

- Download `curl` for Windows: [https://curl.se/windows](https://curl.se/windows)
- Extract the ZIP package.
- Locate `curl.exe`, usually under the `bin\` folder.

---

### 2. Choose a Permanent Folder 

Recommended folders:

- `C:\curl`
- `C:\Program Files\curl`
- `C:\Program Files\tools`

<Note>
Do **not** move the folder once placed.
</Note>

---

### 3. Add to PATH

<Tip>
Open a Windows PowerShell or CMD as **Administrator**.
</Tip>

#### Steps:

1. Press `Win` and type **environment**
2. Select **Edit the system environment variables**
3. Click on **Environment Variables**
4. Under **System variables**, select `Path` and click **Edit**
5. Click **New** and add the path (e.g., `C:\curl`)
6. Click **OK** and restart your console

<Note>
If the folder is not in PATH, you'll need to navigate manually every time you use `curl`.
</Note>

## Test the Installation

Open a Command Prompt and run:

```bash
curl -V
```

You should see version information if curl is installed correctly.
