## Installing Linux agent

<Note>
    The Linux agent captures system and application logs and sends them to a UTMStack master server or probe/proxy, monitors system activity, and executes incident response commands. The UTMStack agents communicate over ports 9000 and 50051. Please make sure these ports are open.
</Note>

### 1. Install or uninstall the UTMStack agent according to your operating system:

    Agent installation commands for operating systems **must be copied directly from your UTMStack instance**, under the **Integrations** section.  
    This ensures that all tokens, identifiers, and configuration parameters are accurate and specific to your environment.
</Warning>
