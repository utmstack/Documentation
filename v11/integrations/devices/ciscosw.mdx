## Installing Cisco Switch

> [!WARNING]
> This integration requires a UTMStack agent to work properly. Please, make sure you have installed it before you continue.

> This integration relies on Syslog. Logs received via Syslog are parsed and correlated by UTMStack automatically.

### 1. Configure your device to send logs to a UTMStack agent on ports:

- 1470 TCP
- 514 UDP

### 2. Enable log collector.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable the log collector where you have the UTMStack agent installed, follow the instructions below based on your operating system and preferred protocol.

> [!TIP]
> Execute command according to the selected platform

> [!WARNING]
> Agent installation commands for operating systems **must be copied directly from your UTMStack instance**, under the **Integrations** section.  
> This ensures that all tokens, identifiers, and configuration parameters are accurate and specific to your environment.
