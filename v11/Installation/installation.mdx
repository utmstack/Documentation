This guide provides comprehensive instructions for installing UTMStack v11 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS using the installer script.

<Note>
**Alternative Installation Method**: You can also install UTMStack using an automated ISO image. See the [Installation from ISO](/v11/Installation/installation-from-iso) guide for details.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

### Operating System

<Info>
This installation guide is designed for **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**. UTMStack v11 also supports Red Hat systems.
</Info>

---

## System Requirements

The following recommendations are based on the number of data sources and desired hot log storage retention.

### Definitions

- **Hot log storage**: Non-archived data that can be accessed for analysis at any time
- **Cold log storage**: Archived data that must be restored before accessing
- **Data source**: Any individual source of logs (devices, agents, SaaS integrations)

### Sizing Guidelines

**Assumption**: 60 data sources generate approximately 100 GB of monthly data.

<Tip>
Resources needed for **one month of hot log storage**:

  <Card title="Enterprise Deployment" icon="pi pi-server" iconAlign="left" content="**500 data sources** (1000 GB hot storage)     - 32 CPU Cores     - 64 GB RAM     - 1000 GB Disk Space" />
<Note>
You may combine these tiers to allocate resources based on the number of devices and desired hot log storage retention.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Horizontal Scaling Required**: Going above 500 data sources/devices requires adding secondary nodes (workers) for horizontal scaling. UTMStack v11's new architecture supports this seamlessly.
</Warning>

## Required Network Ports

The following ports must be accessible for UTMStack to function properly:

### Administrative Access Ports

<Accordion multiple={true}>
    <AccordionTab header="Port 22/TCP - Secure Shell (SSH)">

  </AccordionTab>
  
    <AccordionTab header="Port 80/TCP - HTTP Redirector">

    **Purpose**: UTMStack Web-based GUI redirector (redirects to HTTPS)
    
    **Security Recommendation**: Create a firewall rule to allow access only from admin and security analyst workstations
  
  </AccordionTab>
  
    <AccordionTab header="Port 443/TCP - HTTPS">

    **Purpose**: UTMStack Web-based Graphical User Interface
    
    **Security Recommendation**: Create a firewall rule to allow access only from admin and security analyst workstations
  
  </AccordionTab>
  
    <AccordionTab header="Port 9090/TCP - Cockpit">

    **Purpose**: Cockpit Web-based Server Management Interface
    
    **Security Recommendation**: Create a firewall rule to allow access only from admin workstations
  
  </AccordionTab>
</Accordion>

### Integration Ports

<Info>
Additional ports will be required during the configuration of UTMStack's integrations to receive logs. Please follow the security recommendations provided in each integration guide.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Preparing for Installation

Update the system and install required dependencies:

```bash
# Update packages list
sudo apt update

# Install WGET
sudo apt install wget

# Download the latest installer
wget http://github.com/utmstack/UTMStack/releases/latest/download/installer

# Switch to root user
sudo su

# Set execution permissions
chmod +x installer
```

<Note>
Make sure you have a stable internet connection during the installation process.
</Note>

---

### Step 2: Running the Installation

Execute the installer without parameters:

```bash
./installer
```

The installer will:
1. Check system requirements
2. Download necessary components
3. Configure the system
4. Set up containers and services
5. Generate initial credentials

<Info>
The installation process may take 15-30 minutes depending on your internet connection and system resources.
</Info>

---

### Step 3: Post-Installation Configuration

Once UTMStack is installed, you can access the platform:

#### Default Credentials

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: Generated during installation

<Warning>
The password and other generated configurations can be found in `/root/utmstack.yml`

**Important**: Store these credentials securely and change the default password immediately after first login.
</Warning>

#### Accessing the Platform

Use HTTPS to access the login page:

```
https://your-server-ip
```

or

```
https://your-domain.com
```

<Note>
UTMStack requires HTTPS for secure access. HTTP requests will be automatically redirected to HTTPS.
</Note>

---

## Post-Installation Steps

  ### Secure Your Credentials

    1. Back up the `/root/utmstack.yml` file to a secure location
    2. Change the default admin password
    3. Enable and configure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - **mandatory in v11**
  ### Configure Firewall Rules

    Set up firewall rules according to the port requirements and security recommendations above
  ### Configure SSL Certificate

    For production environments, configure a valid SSL certificate:
    - Use Let's Encrypt with Certbot (recommended)
    - Or import your own SSL certificate
    
    See the SSL Certificate configuration guide for detailed instructions
  ### Connect Data Sources

    Begin connecting your data sources and integrations:
    - Install agents on endpoints
    - Configure log forwarding from network devices
    - Set up SaaS integrations
  ### Configure Central Management (Optional)

    If you're managing multiple UTMStack instances, configure central server connectivity for:
    - Centralized updates
    - Remote log submission
    - Unified management
---

## Verification

After installation, verify that UTMStack is running correctly:

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# Check system logs
docker logs utmstack_backend

# Verify web interface accessibility
curl -k https://localhost
```

All containers should be in a "healthy" or "running" state.

---

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion multiple={true}>
    <AccordionTab header="Installation fails due to insufficient resources">

    Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements for your deployment size. Check available RAM, CPU, and disk space:
    
    ```bash
    free -h
    lscpu
    df -h
    ```
  
  </AccordionTab>
  
    <AccordionTab header="Cannot access web interface">

    1. Verify firewall rules allow ports 80 and 443
    2. Check that containers are running: `docker ps`
    3. Verify HTTPS is being used in the URL
    4. Check system logs: `docker logs utmstack_backend`
  
  </AccordionTab>
  
    <AccordionTab header="Forgot admin password">

    The generated password is stored in `/root/utmstack.yml`. Access this file as root to recover the credentials.
  
  </AccordionTab>
  
    <AccordionTab header="Installation interrupted or failed">

    1. Remove existing installation: `./installer --remove`
    2. Clean up Docker resources: `docker system prune -a`
    3. Restart the installation process
  
  </AccordionTab>
</Accordion>

---

## Additional Installation Options

### Red Hat Installation

UTMStack v11 now supports Red Hat-based systems. The installation process is similar, but uses `dnf` instead of `apt`:

```bash
# Update packages
sudo dnf update

# Install WGET
sudo dnf install wget

# Continue with standard installation steps
```

---

## Scaling Your Deployment

UTMStack v11 introduces horizontal scaling capabilities with worker nodes.

### Adding Worker Nodes

To scale beyond 500 data sources or improve processing capacity:

1. Install UTMStack on additional servers using the same installer
2. Configure them as worker nodes during installation
3. Connect workers to the manager node
4. Distribute processing load automatically

<Info>
Worker nodes can run plugins and process data in parallel with the manager, eliminating bottlenecks and providing linear scalability.
