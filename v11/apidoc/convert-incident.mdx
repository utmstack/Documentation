## Overview

This endpoint allows security analysts to convert selected alerts into a formal security incident. This is useful when multiple related alerts need to be investigated together or when an alert requires escalation to incident response procedures.

> [!NOTE]
> **Authorization Required:** All requests must include a valid API Key in the header `utm-api-key`.

const convertToIncident = async () => {
  
  const payload = {
    eventIds: ["c1c4e32c-dd9f-4a15-98c4-0dac2af40740"],

```python Python

        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

## When to Convert to Incident

<Accordion multiple={true}>
  <AccordionTab title="Accordion Item" >

    **Convert when:**
    - Alert requires extensive investigation
    - Multiple teams need to collaborate
    - Formal incident response procedures required
    - Compliance documentation needed

  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab title="Accordion Item" >

    **Convert when:**
    - Alerts are part of the same attack campaign
    - Correlation analysis reveals connections
    - Coordinated response needed across multiple systems
    - Timeline reconstruction required

  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab title="Accordion Item" >

    **Convert when:**
    - Alert severity requires management attention
    - Potential data breach or compromise
    - Customer-impacting security event
    - Regulatory reporting required

  </AccordionTab>

</Accordion>

## Best Practices

<Accordion multiple={true}>
  <AccordionTab title="Accordion Item" >

    **Use descriptive names:**
    - Include attack type: "Brute Force Attack Investigation"
    - Reference affected systems: "Web Server Compromise - Server01"
    - Add timeline context: "Ransomware Incident - Oct 2024"
    - Be specific but concise

  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab title="Accordion Item" >

    **ID assignment strategy:**
    - Use sequential numbering for easy tracking
    - Consider year/month prefixes: 202410001
    - Reserve ID ranges for different incident types
    - Ensure uniqueness across the organization

  </AccordionTab>

  <AccordionTab title="Accordion Item" >

    **Provide clear sources:**
    - "SOC Team Escalation" for manual escalations
    - "Automated Correlation Engine" for system-detected patterns
    - "Customer Report" for externally reported issues
    - Include analyst name for accountability

  </AccordionTab>

## Integration with Incident Management

> [!INFO]
> **Platform Integration:**
> - Converted incidents appear in the UTMStack incident management interface
> - Original alerts remain linked to the incident for reference
> - Incident timeline includes all alert details and timestamps
> - Case management workflow is automatically initiated
> - Notifications sent to configured incident response team members
---
## Security Considerations

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Notes:**
> - Requires Bearer token authentication
> - Incident creation is audited for compliance
> - Only authorized users can convert alerts to incidents
> - Incident IDs must be unique to prevent conflicts
> - Alert IDs must exist and be accessible to the user
