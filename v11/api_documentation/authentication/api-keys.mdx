API Keys provide secure programmatic access to UTMStack's API endpoints. This guide walks you through creating, managing, and using API keys for authentication.

> [!INFO]
> API Keys are an alternative authentication method to user credentials, ideal for integrations, automation scripts, and third-party applications.

## Accessing API Keys Management

### Open Connection Keys Section

Select **Connection Keys** from the settings menu to access the Connection Keys management page.

![API Keys Management Page](/images/apidoc/api-keys-list.png)

The API Keys page displays a table with:

- **Name**: Descriptive name of the API key
- **Created At**: Timestamp when the key was created
- **Expires At**: Expiration date and time
- **Status indicators**: Red icon for expired or problematic keys, green for active
- **Actions**: Icons to view details, regenerate, or delete each key
- **Pagination**: Navigate through multiple pages of API keys at the bottom

## Creating a New API Key

### Click Create API Key

On the API Keys page, locate and click the **Create Api Key** button in the top right corner.

![Create API Key Button](/images/apidoc/api-keys-list.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The button is positioned above the API keys table for easy access.

### Configure API Key Details

A modal dialog titled **"Create Api Key"** will appear with the following fields:

![Create API Key Form](/images/apidoc/create-api-key-form.png)

### Name

Enter a descriptive name for your API key (e.g., "Integration Agent", "Monitoring Script", "Test").

> [!TIP]
> Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the purpose and environment of the key.

### Set Expiration Date

Click the calendar icon next to **"Expires At"** to open the date picker.

Select a future date when the API key should expire (e.g., `2035-11-01`).

**Best Practices**:

- Set shorter expiration periods for testing or temporary integrations (30-90 days)
- Use longer periods (e.g., 1 year) for production integrations
- Regularly rotate API keys before expiration for enhanced security

> [!NOTE]
> Expired keys will be automatically disabled and cannot be used for authentication. You'll need to regenerate them.

### Configure Allowed IPs (Security)

In the **"Allowed IPs"** field, add IP addresses or CIDR ranges that are permitted to use this API key.

**Input Format**:

- Type or paste an IP address or CIDR notation
- Click the plus icon (⊕) to add it to the allowed list
- Example placeholder: `Add IP address or CIDR (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)`

**Format Examples**:

- Single IP: `192.168.1.10`
- CIDR Range: `192.168.1.0/24`
- Multiple entries: Add each IP/CIDR separately by clicking the plus icon

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Recommendation**: Always restrict API keys to specific IP addresses or ranges. The form will show an error message "Please enter an IP address or CIDR" if you try to proceed without adding at least one IP.  
> Avoid leaving this field empty unless absolutely necessary for your use case.

### Create the API Key

Click the **Create API Key** button to generate the key.

### Copy and Secure Your API Key

After clicking **Create Api Key**, a success dialog titled **"Generated Api Key"** will appear displaying your newly created API key.

The dialog shows:

- A message: "COPY YOUR API KEY AS IT WILL BE SHOWN ONLY ONCE"
- The API key value (partially masked with dots: `••••••••`)
- A **Copy** button to copy the key to your clipboard
- A **Close** button

> [!WARNING]
> **CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY**: This is the **only time** you will see the complete API key.  
> **Action Required**:
> 1. Click the **Copy** button immediately to copy the key to your clipboard
> 2. Paste and store it in a secure password manager or secrets vault
> 3. **You cannot retrieve this key again** - if lost, you must regenerate it
> 4. Only click **Close** after you have safely stored the key

> [!TIP]
> Verify that you've successfully copied the key by pasting it into a secure location before closing the dialog.
