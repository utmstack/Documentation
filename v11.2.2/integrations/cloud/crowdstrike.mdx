## Step 3: Generate API Credentials

1. Provide a descriptive **Client name** (for example: `UTMStack_SIEM_Connector`).
2. Select the required **API scopes** for Event Streams.
3. Click **Create**.

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure that the scopes required for Event Streams access are properly selected.
## Step 4: Record API Credentials

After creating the client:

1. Copy and securely store the following information:

- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret**
- **Base URL** (region-specific)

> [!WARNING]
> The Client Secret is shown only once. If lost, a new secret must be generated.

## Step 5: Enter the Configuration in UTMStack

1. Go to the **CrowdStrike integration module** within UTMStack.
2. Fill in the following fields using the information generated in CrowdStrike:
    - **Client ID**: The Client ID generated in CrowdStrike.

- **Client Secret**: The Client Secret generated.
- **Cloud Region URL**: The regional Base URL (for example: `https://api.eu-1.crowdstrike.com`).
- **App Name**: A descriptive name to identify the integration.

1. Click **Save configuration** to store the settings.

> [!NOTE]
> You can add more than one CrowdStrike configuration by clicking **Add tenant** if multiple tenants need to be integrated.

## Step 6: Activate the Integration

1. After saving the configuration, click the corresponding button to activate the UTMStack features related to this integration.
2. If the integration is active, the button will display **Disable integration**, indicating that it is enabled successfully.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure the integration is activated so UTMStack can start receiving events from CrowdStrike.
