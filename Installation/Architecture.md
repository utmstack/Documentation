# Architecture and Deployment Models

UTMStack offers a flexible and scalable architecture, empowering organizations to choose from various deployment models that best suit their needs. Whether deployed on the cloud or on-premises, UTMStack can seamlessly adapt to any scenario, providing a robust and comprehensive cybersecurity solution.

# Deployment Models
UTMStack presents four compelling deployment models, each catering to specific requirements and offering distinct advantages:

## 1. Master Only Deployment: Unparalleled Data Control and Security

A **Master Only Deployment** of UTMStack is dedicated to an individual customer, ensuring unparalleled data control and security.

By opting for a master-only installation, organizations can maintain complete control over their data. UTMStack can be effortlessly deployed within the customer's network, whether on a virtual machine or a physical server. This approach allows for direct log gathering from customer devices and applications, ensuring data remains within the organization's boundaries.

With data isolation and enhanced security, the master-only deployment model offers peace of mind, particularly for organizations concerned about sharing sensitive information with third parties.

## 2. Federated Master Deployment: Streamlined Management for MSPs

The **federated master deployment model** is ideal for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) managing multiple instances of UTMStack.

In this model, multiple master servers are deployed, with one in each customer's network. A central federation service acts as a unified monitoring panel, allowing MSPs to effortlessly oversee alerts generated by separate systems from a single centralized interface.

This streamlined approach simplifies monitoring and management, enabling MSPs to efficiently navigate activities across multiple clients and organizations. 

The federated master deployment model is commonly used by SOC teams for its simplicity and effectiveness.


## 3. UTMStack Master & Proxy: Optimal Flexibility and Security

The **UTMStack master and proxy deployment model** offers optimal flexibility and security, making it suitable for Managed Services Providers (MSPs) looking to host UTMStack within their network.

By deploying UTMStack within their infrastructure, MSPs gain complete control over their network and data. Lightweight proxy servers are then installed within each customer's network, functioning as local master servers. These proxies serve as intermediaries, securely collecting logs from customer devices and forwarding them to the central master server.

This deployment model is particularly useful when capturing and transmitting logs from customer firewall devices. Instead of sending logs directly over the internet, which may not be recommended for security reasons, the Probe proxy acts as a secure intermediary. It captures the logs locally within the customer's network and securely transmits them to the Master Server over the internet.


By implementing the UTMStack master and proxy model, MSPs can ensure the secure and efficient collection of logs from customer networks, enabling effective monitoring and analysis while maintaining a high level of data protection and privacy.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

Please note that a proxy is not always required.

UTMstack supports SysLog TLS and all communications between agents and master servers are encrypted using TLS.

The proxy is recommended only if customer servers are not allowed to access the internet or there are devices like old firewalls that do not support TLS encryption over the internet.

Agents can be installed in customer servers directly without needing a proxy.
Devices that support Syslog TLS can send logs directly to UTMStack.

## 4. SaaS (Software as a Service): Simplified Management with Unparalleled Support

For organizations seeking for a hassle-free and fully managed solution, UTMStack offers the **Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment model**.

With SaaS, organizations can benefit from a comprehensive managed instance of UTMStack, including updates, scaling, backups, high availability, and dedicated support. Logs can be effortlessly collected from customer systems by installing agents or configuring SyslogTLS or proxy.

This streamlined approach allows organizations to focus on their core business, leaving the complexities of cybersecurity management to the experts at UTMStack. Enjoy the peace of mind that comes with a fully managed solution, ensuring top-notch security and efficiency without the burden of infrastructure management.

UTMStack's flexible deployment models empower organizations and MSPs to choose the most suitable approach based on their specific requirements, infrastructure, and security preferences. By offering a range of options, UTMStack ensures that organizations of all sizes and complexities can enjoy the benefits of a robust and comprehensive cybersecurity platform.
