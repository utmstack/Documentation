### Adding Reports

Our module also understands the need for specific reporting within each compliance standard. Therefore, it offers you the ability to add new reports to an existing compliance standard.

To add a new report, select the desired standard and section where you want to include the report. You can then choose from an existing report dashboard and integrate it into your selected compliance section.

### Import/Export

Recognizing the need for interoperability and seamless transitions across various systems, the Compliance Management module is equipped with an advanced import/export feature. This tool is designed to help you efficiently manage and transport your compliance information.

To **export** your current compliance data, the module offers the ability to create a comprehensive JSON file. This file encapsulates all the necessary details of your compliance standards, sections, and reports. By clicking on the 'Export All' button, a complete snapshot of your current compliance setup is instantly packaged into a portable file, ensuring no critical details are lost during transit. This is particularly useful for backup purposes, migrating to a new system, or simply sharing your compliance structure with other teams or departments.

The **import** feature plays a crucial role when you need to populate the module with existing compliance data from another system. By using the 'Import All' button, you can upload the JSON file containing the requisite data. The module will seamlessly integrate this data, ensuring your compliance standards, sections, and reports are set up exactly as per your previous system.
