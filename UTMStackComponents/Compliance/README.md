# Compliance Management

Welcome to our in-depth guide on the **Compliance Management** module, a key feature of our cybersecurity software platform.

Each standard is categorized. By default, the categories available are:

- **Account Management**
- **Device Activity**
- **Application Audit**
- **Alerts and Incidents**


Each standard has its dedicated section.

For example, if you wish to monitor the Office 365 Account Activity regarding successful logins, you can navigate to the relevant category. Upon selecting it, you'll receive a detailed description of the report and the compliance standards it addresses.

## Supported Compliance Standards
Our module supports several critical compliance standards, ensuring that your organization stays compliant in various sectors:

### 1. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
HIPAA is a U.S. federal law that sets national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from unauthorized disclosure. The HIPAA section within the Compliance Management module incorporates reports specifically designed to monitor compliance with critical HIPAA provisions, such as sections §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)(D), §164.312(b), and others. Each report aims to facilitate the implementation of policies and procedures to detect and manage security violations effectively.

### 2. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
GDPR is a comprehensive data protection law in the European Union (EU), which regulates the processing of personal data. The software offers pre-configured reports to ensure that your data processing operations adhere to GDPR's core principles.

GLBA, also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999, controls how financial institutions handle the private information of individuals. The GLBA section in the module contains reports tailored to key GLBA provisions, assisting you in maintaining GLBA compliance.

### 4. System and Organization Controls 2 (SOC 2)
SOC 2 report focuses on a business’s non-financial reporting controls relating to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a system. The software provides essential reports aligned with the Control Criteria (CC) of SOC 2 to facilitate the achievement and maintenance of SOC 2 compliance.

### 5. Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
FISMA is a U.S. federal law that mandates federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an information security and protection program. The module provides pre-defined reports monitoring compliance with FISMA's crucial sections.

### 6. Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
CMMC certification is a requirement for businesses bidding on U.S. Government contracts. The CMMC section within the module provides reports specifically designed to monitor compliance with different CMMC Levels.

### 7. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)
PCI-DSS is a set of standards for managing and securing credit card-related personal data. The PCI-DSS section in the Compliance Management module provides reports aligned with specific PCI requirements, ensuring that your credit card data processing activities remain within the bounds of PCI-DSS standards.

### Import/Export

Acknowledging the need for system interoperability, the **Compliance Management** module boasts a robust import/export function. This tool aids in the proficient handling and transfer of compliance data.

By utilizing the 'Export All' button, a complete portrayal of your compliance configuration is readily compiled, ensuring data integrity.

For **importing**, should there be a necessity to infuse the module with compliance data from an alternative system, the 'Import All' button facilitates this. Simply upload the corresponding JSON file, and the module will fluidly merge the data, aligning with your prior system's setup.
