You can filter the sources based on their groups or types, offering a simplified and organized view that enables easy navigation through a vast array of devices.

## Managing Data Source Actions

For each data source, users have the capability to perform various actions:

### 1. Assigning a Type

You can attribute a type to a data source, enhancing its identification and categorization process.

### 2. Adding to a Group

Data sources can be aggregated into specific groups. This feature is particularly beneficial in different scenarios, such as grouping devices by their function, location, or other relevant parameters.

### 3. Adding a Note

This feature allows users to add specific notes to a data source, thereby aiding in the provision of additional information or context about the device.

### 4. Executing Actions

In some cases, you may need to execute specific actions on a data source, such as running a particular command. This module provides you with the functionality to carry out such actions directly.

## Managing Source View

The Source View Management feature empowers users to customize the type of data sources they want to visualize in the dashboard. This ability to personalize the display aids in streamlining the focus towards the most relevant data sources.
