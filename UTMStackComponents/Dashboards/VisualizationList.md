You can filter the list based on the following parameters:

* **Visualization Name**: Filter by the name of the visualization.
* **Chart Type**: Filter by the type of chart used in the visualization (e.g., bar, line, pie).
* **Source**: Filter by the index pattern used for the visualization.
* **Created At**: Filter by the date the visualization was created.
* **Modified At**: Filter by the date the visualization was last updated.

Each filter field helps refine the visualizations displayed, aiding in quickly locating the visualization you need.

2. **List of Visualizations**
The main body of the Visualizations List displays the visualizations available to you.

For each visualization, you'll find:

* **Name**: The unique identifier for the visualization.
* **Comments**: Any additional comments or descriptions for the visualization.
* **Index Pattern**: The specific data source pattern used in the visualization.
* **Last Modified**: The date and time of the last update made to the visualization.
* **Action** : Each visualization entry also has an Actions column, with buttons for:
    * **Edit**: Opens the visualization for modification.
    * **Delete**: Permanently removes the visualization from the list.

3. **Import Visualization**
The Import Visualization button allows you to import previously exported visualizations, facilitating easy replication of visualizations across different dashboards or UTMStack instances.

4. **New Visualization**
The New Visualization button opens the Visualization Editor, providing a platform to create custom visualizations from scratch. Here, you can define data source, set filters, and specify other parameters to build your visualization.
