## Index Management

Index management in UTMStack allows for maintaining the organization and performance of indices similarly to Elasticsearch. It facilitates the administration of indices, including their deletion, and monitoring.


### Managing Indices


- To **delete an index**, click on the delete action (‚ùå) next to the index you wish to remove. Be cautious as this action is irreversible.

### Searching Within an Index

Use the search bar at the top of the index table to filter and search for specific indices.

### Notes

- The indices are automatically named based on the date and type of logs they contain.
- The status `open` indicates that the index is active and can be written to or searched.

**Tip:** Regularly monitor the size and document count of your indices to ensure optimal performance and storage management.
