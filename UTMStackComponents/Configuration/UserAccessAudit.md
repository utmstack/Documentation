## User Access Audit

The User Access Audit tracks all user login attempts, their timestamps, and the state of authenticationâ€”successful or otherwise. This log can be used for security monitoring, identifying usage patterns, and troubleshooting access issues.


### Reviewing the Audit Log

To review the User Access Audit:

1. Navigate to the `User Access Audit` section in the UTMStack dashboard.
2. You can filter the log by date.
3. Analyze the data as required for security assessments or compliance checks.

### Understanding the States

- `AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESS`: Indicates the user successfully authenticated.
- `AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE`: Indicates an unsuccessful authentication attempt.
