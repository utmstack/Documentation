## License

This section of the UTMStack configuration guides you through the process of licensing your product.

### Current License Status

Upon installation, UTMStack operates under a **free version** which provides basic functionality. Here's the current status of your installation:

- **Name:** `utmstack`
- **Email:** `utmstack@localhost`
- **License ID:** *Not applicable for free version*
- **Activation:** UTMStack is not activated; you are using the FREE version of this product.
- **Expiration:** *Not applicable for free version*

### Upgrading to a Paid License

To unlock the full capabilities of UTMStack, a paid license is required. A paid license provides access to advanced features, dedicated support, and regular updates that are essential for maintaining robust cybersecurity.

#### Steps to Purchase and Activate a License:

1. **Purchase a License:** Visit the UTMStack pricing page at [UTMStack Pricing](https://utmstack.com/pricing/) to select and purchase a license that fits your organizational needs.
   
2. **Activate Your License:**
   - Once you have purchased a license, you will receive a **License ID**.
   - Enter the License ID in the designated field on the UTMStack configuration page.
   - Click the '**Activate**' button to verify and apply your license.

### Post-Activation

After activating your license, you should receive confirmation that your paid license is active. The License section will then be updated with the following details:

- **Activation:** Reflects the status as 'Activated.'
- **Expiration:** Displays the expiry date of your current license.

Remember to renew your license before the expiration date to ensure uninterrupted service and support.
