## Overview

The Technical Reports module is subdivided into various sections, each comprising a set of dedicated reports. These sections serve to categorize the reports based on their relevance and the type of data they analyze, allowing users to easily navigate and select the most suitable report for their needs. Here are the default sections provided:

### System Reports

### User Management

The User Management section provides valuable reports that help you monitor and manage user accounts within your organization. You can analyze data on account creation, modification, deletion, and other user account activities. This aids in ensuring that user management within your organization adheres to best practices and security norms.

### User Logon Report

The Removable Storage Device section offers reports that monitor the usage of removable storage devices within your system. It can help track data transfers, unauthorized device usage, and more, thus aiding in data loss prevention and ensuring compliance with your organization's data handling policies.
