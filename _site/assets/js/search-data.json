    "content": "Alert Management isn’t just a component—it’s the bedrock of any effective security information and event management (SIEM) system. Its raison d’être lies in actively monitoring diverse data sources, pinpointing anomalies, detecting suspicious activities, and accordingly manifesting alerts in line with pre-configured correlation rules. The overarching objective? To empower organizations with actionable insights, ensuring the inviolability of their digital perimeter. Our Alert Management system is fueled by a state-of-the-art correlation engine. This dynamo tirelessly processes incoming data in real-time, juxtaposes it against a matrix of defined correlation rules, and depending on the potential risk magnitude, spawns an alert with a corresponding severity. This module acts as the nerve center for all alerts detected, showcasing pertinent details and allowing for effective alert handling. It’s not just a tool; it’s your vantage point to preemptively mitigate risks. ",

    "title": "1. Data Grid",
    "content": "The heart of our Alert Management system, the Data Grid, is an interactive tableau of all detected alerts. It collates and exhibits salient details: . | Rule Name: The specific set of conditions that birthed the alert. | Severity: The urgency quotient attached to the alert. | Status: A real-time status indicator—new, under review, or resolved. | Sensor: The data source or trigger point that sensed the potential jeopardy. | . The Data Grid, apart from its intuitive design, allows alerts to be catalogued based on any field, defaulting to a chronological hierarchy. Key Alert Operations . Dive deeper with these pivotal operations: . Converting an Alert to an Incident . Not all alerts are born equal. Some demand heightened scrutiny. Use the ‘Create Incident’ feature to either instantiate a new incident from an alert or annex it to an existing incident. Once an alert graduates to an incident status, an automatic email dispatch takes place, notifying stakeholders listed in the UTMStack settings. Craving more on incidents? Dive into our Incident Guide. Tagging Alerts: Beyond the False Positive . Hand-in-hand with alerts come false positives. Our system grants you the ability to create Tag Rules directly from alert fields, defaulting with the “False Positive” tag. Once tagged as a false positive through a rule, similar alerts won’t bombard your dashboard. Distilling Alerts through Filters . Harness the power of filters to refine your alert view. With a simple selection, morph your alert landscape based on attributes of your choice. Annotating Alerts . Collaboration is key in any cybersecurity endeavor. The ability to annotate alerts allows teams to share insights, questions, or additional context regarding the nature and potential implications of an alert. These annotations act as collaborative markers, ensuring that team members operate with a common understanding of potential threats. ",

In some scenarios, offline analysis and record-keeping are indispensable. The ‘Save Report’ feature allows users to extract and download a comprehensive report of the alerts in a standard CSV format. Whether it’s a deep dive into the past week’s data or a broader look at alert trends, this feature facilitates flexible data export for any analytical or compliance need. Manage Tags . Tagging is more than just a labeling exercise—it’s about classification, prioritization, and quick identification. The ‘Manage Tags’ feature empowers users to define their taxonomy of tags, ensuring that alerts can be swiftly categorized and acted upon. View Tag Rules . Automation meets classification in the ‘View Tag Rules’ section. Here, you can define, review, and manage rules that automatically tag incoming alerts based on pre-set conditions. This auto-tagging not only streamlines alert handling but also introduces a degree of predictability in how alerts are categorized. By embracing the full suite of features in our Alert Management Module, organizations can equip themselves to rapidly identify, classify, and react to potential threats.

This allows users to refine the command list based on parameters such as status, platform, user, or rule name. Automation Rule Details . Clicking on an automation rule opens a new window displaying the automation rule details. The details include: . | Description: Provides a description of the automation rule. | Execute on agents with: Specifies the required operating system to execute the command. | Excluding: Lists the agents excluded from the execution. | Trigger when: Describes the rule conditions based on the incident fields that trigger the execution. | Execution Command: Displays the command that is going to be executed when the alert triggers. | Rule History: Shows the history of changes for the Rule. | . Create Automation Rule . The ‘Create Automation’ button at the top-right corner of the dashboard provides an option to create a new automation rule. It guides users through the steps for creating an Incident Response Automation. Step 1: Automation Information . The first step is to provide a name and description for the automation rule. Both can contain spaces. Step 2: Trigger Configuration . The second step is to configure the conditions for executing the command. Users can add multiple conditions based on the incident fields. The conditions are exact matches. Users can also specify the agent platform where the command will be executed and exclude any specific agents if desired. Step 3: Action Configuration . The last step is to define the action through a command line that will be executed on the device. By pressing the TAB key, users can access alert fields and incorporate them into the command execution by simply clicking on them. Conclusion . By automating actions based on incident triggers, organizations can streamline their incident response process, reduce response times, minimize errors, and ensure consistent and standardized incident handling. The Incident Response Automation feature empowers organizations to enhance their incident response capabilities and mitigate the impact of security incidents more efficiently. ",

    "content": "The Log Explorer Module, a central element of UTMStack, is purpose-built to deliver an exhaustive and comprehensive view of an organization’s log data. This dynamic, highly interactive tool is engineered to provide real-time visibility into log data, allowing for immediate filtering and nuanced analysis. Its central role in the proactive monitoring and effective management of network activities is indispensable to a well-maintained cybersecurity infrastructure. Overview . The Log Explorer interface has been thoughtfully designed for seamless navigation and efficient functionality. The module’s centerpiece is the Data Grid, a feature offering an extensive view of an organization’s log data based on the defined datasource and query. This enables a logical grouping of queries based on user-defined filters, and the capacity to open multiple tabs for various queries. This level of customization empowers users to save their search criteria for future use, making the tool adaptable and time-efficient. In a concerted effort to make data analysis as user-friendly as possible, the Log Explorer module provides visually intuitive representations of logs. Interactive charts and graphs facilitate an at-a-glance understanding of data trends and patterns, simplifying the task of data interpretation. 1. Source . A key aspect of the Log Explorer module is the source functionality. Serving as a crucial data filtering tool, it lets users narrow down their search to specific index patterns. For instance, users can confine their search, for example, to logs originating from Office365 exclusively, thereby eliminating unnecessary data noise. In addition, this module offers the flexibility to create custom index patterns or sources. This allows users to define search parameters that cater to their specific needs, providing a level of personalization that ensures a more targeted and efficient search experience. 2. Filters . Serving as the backbone of the Log Explorer, the filtering functionality offers comprehensive data parsing based on the user’s search requirements. Filters can be defined to track logs from a specific computer, or to isolate logs pertaining to a specific operation, such as a log-in event. The versatility of these filters provides an unparalleled level of control over data analysis. The Log Explorer module simplifies filter creation by providing the option to add a filter based on a specific log field with a single click. This degree of simplicity ensures that users can focus more on the analysis and less on the process. 3. Data Grid . The Data Grid is where the bulk of log information can be viewed, offering users the choice of viewing the data in a table or chart format. This visualization is predicated on a selected field, allowing for a high degree of customization. Users can also define the columns they want to see in the Table mode view, either through the Select fields option on the left, or by directly selecting a field in the log. 4 The Log . The Log section offers a comprehensive view of all log information, ranging from agent_id, process name, to the source IP. This data can be viewed in two ways – either in a table view or in a JSON mode – depending on the user’s preference. The Table mode offers the added benefit of allowing the user to add filters based on the field and value of a specific log, or to create a column in the Data Grid table based on a specific field. 4.1 Options . Each log field within the Log Explorer module provides two key options for users: . | Adding a filter: Based on the field and value of a specific log, users can swiftly add a filter. This feature further fine-tunes the data presented in the Data Grid, refining the log data to fit the user’s specific needs. | Creating a column: Users can choose to create a new column in the Data Grid Table based on the field. This feature allows for immediate visibility and accessibility of key data points. | . 5. Personalize Fields . You can also add or remove columns in the Data Grid view, based on the fields of the logs. 5. Save the information . Users can refresh their data, save the current query for future use, or export the current data to a CSV file for offline analysis. For example, a filter to view all Office365 log-in activities could be saved for future use, negating the need to repeat the filter creation process. The option to view and manage stored queries also ensures that past investigations can be revisited with ease. By offering these customizable options, the Log Explorer module delivers an adaptable interface that caters to the specific requirements of individual users. Whether it’s streamlining data analysis by focusing on certain values or enhancing visibility of crucial data, these options ensure a more efficient and tailored log exploration experience.

Users can further refine this data using specific aggregation buckets. For an in-depth understanding of metric aggregations and bucket aggregations associated with each chart type, please refer to the respective chart’s documentation section. Applying Filters to Visualizations . One of the critical steps in creating a visualization is filtering the data you want to display. This involves comparing a specific field with a selected value using an operator. For instance, suppose you want to create a visualization focusing on Office 365 logon failures. In this case, select the field logx.o365.ResultStatus.keyword and apply the IS operator to check for equality to the value Failure.This filter will limit the visualization to the unsuccessful login attempts in Office 365. Understanding Filter Operators . Filter operators in UTMStack help fine-tune data selection within visualizations. Here are the available operators and their functionalities: . | Is: This operator selects all data entries matching the specific value chosen. | Is Not: Contrary to ‘Is’, this operator selects all data entries that do not match the specific value chosen. | Is One Of: This operator selects all data entries that match any value from a set of values specified. | Is Not One Of: This operator selects all data entries that do not match any value from a set of values specified. | Exists: This operator selects all data entries where the specified field exists. | Does Not Exist: This operator selects all data entries where the specified field does not exist. | Is Between: This operator selects numeric data within a specific value range. The range must align with the input pattern for each data field. For instance, the pattern for @timestamp is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM: SS.MsMsMsZ (2021-12-12T02:30:00.000Z.) . | Is Not Between: This operator selects numeric data not within a specific value range. | Contains: This operator selects all data entries containing a specific string. | Does Not Contain: This operator selects all data entries that do not contain a specific string. | Starts With: This operator selects all data entries that start with a specific string. | Does Not Start With: This operator selects all data entries that do not start with a specific string. | Ends With: This operator selects all data entries that end with a specific string. | Does Not End With: This operator selects all data entries that do not end with a specific string. | . The applied filters appear at the top of the interface, where they can be edited, deleted, or reverted as needed. Having selected your chart type and set up your filters, the next step involves adjusting specific parameters to your chosen chart type.

    "content": "In UTMStack, crafting the right visualization involves the careful selection and application of metric and bucket aggregations. These play a pivotal role in determining how your data is analyzed and presented. | Metric Aggregation Choose the right metric aggregations for your chart. UTMStack offers several aggregations options: | . | Count: Returns a raw count of the elements in the selected index pattern. | Average: Returns the average of a numeric field. You’ll need to select the appropriate field from the drop-down. | Sum: Returns the total sum of a numeric field. Choose the relevant field from the drop-down. | Min: Returns the minimum value of a numeric field. Select the corresponding field from the drop-down. | Max: Returns the maximum value of a numeric field. Choose the appropriate field from the drop-down. | Unique Count: Returns the number of unique values in a field (cardinality aggregation). Select the relevant field from the drop-down. | . For each aggregation, you can change the default display label by entering a custom string in the “Custom Label” field. The Add Metrics button and the red cross symbol allow you to add or remove aggregations as per your needs. | Bucket Aggregation Bucket aggregation serves to categorize data based on specific criteria, enabling meaningful insights. The two bucket aggregation types in UTMStack are: | . | Date Histogram: This type constructs a date-wise distribution based on a numeric field. Here, you need to pick a field representing the timeline and stipulate a minimum time frame (options include minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly) in the Minimum intervals. For a custom interval frame, select the Custom interval option and specify a time unit. Time units can be milliseconds (ms), seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h), or days (d). The Custom Label field allows you to modify the display label. | Terms Terms bucket aggregation categorizes data into buckets based on distinct values present in a specified field. These buckets are dynamically generated, each corresponding to a term found in the data field. This approach is beneficial when you want to analyze and visualize data with distinct or categorical values. | . Here’s how you can configure the Terms bucket aggregation in UTMStack: . | Field: Choose the field from which the terms for the buckets will be derived. This field will be the basis for categorizing the data into different buckets. | Order By: Decide how the buckets should be ordered. You can order them based on a metric (e.g., count, sum, average, min, max, etc.) or alphabetically (by term). The bucket with the highest value in the selected metric or alphabetical term will be presented first, depending on your chosen sort direction. | Order: Define the sort direction of the buckets. You can sort the buckets in either ascending or descending order. | Size: Specify the number of terms/buckets that should be returned per page. | Custom Label: If you want to change the default label for the buckets, enter your desired text in the Custom Label field. | .
