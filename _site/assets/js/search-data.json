    "content": "Alert Management is a critical component of any security information and event management (SIEM) system. Its primary function is to monitor various data sources, identify anomalies and suspicious activities, and generate alerts based on predefined correlation rules. It enables organizations to take prompt and effective action against potential threats, ensuring the integrity and safety of their digital assets. Our Alert Management system features an advanced correlation engine, which is responsible for the generation of alerts. The engine scrutinizes the incoming data in real-time and matches it against the defined correlation rules, the engine generates an alert and assigns it a severity based on the potential impact and threat level of the incident. The Alert Management Module forms an integral part of our system, serving as a real-time hub for all the alerts detected by the correlation engine. It efficiently captures, displays, and manages vital information related to these alerts, enhancing your capacity to oversee and control potential risks within your environment. With a myriad of features and capabilities, it facilitates better understanding and management of alerts. ",

    "title": "1. Data Grid",
    "content": "Here, you’ll find a comprehensive list of all alerts detected by our powerful correlation engine. This detailed grid, populated in real-time, houses the most relevant and significant alert information such as: . | Rule Name: The specific rule that triggered the alert. | Severity: The level of seriousness or urgency attached to the alert. | Status: The current state of the alert, indicating whether it’s new, under review, or resolved. | Sensor: The specific source or detector that identified the potential risk, generating the alert. | . With a focus on flexibility and ease of use, the Data Grid allows you to sort alerts based on any field. By default, it organizes alerts chronologically, ensuring that you are always up-to-date with the latest alerts raised by the system. Through this streamlined, interactive interface, you can swiftly navigate and respond to the complex alert landscape, bolstering your system’s defense capabilities. Key Alert Operations . In addition to browsing and sorting alerts, the Alert Management Module allows you to perform three vital operations, which offer deeper insight and aid in effective threat management: . Creating an Incident Based on an Alert . When an alert signifies a significant threat, warranting further investigation or action, you can use the ‘Create Incident’ operation. This feature enables you to create a new incident directly from the alert, or associate the alert with an existing incident. The newly created incident will appear in the Incident Module. To learn more about managing incidents, please refer to our detailed guide here. Creating a New Tag Rule Based on an Alert . The Alert Management Module also allows you to create a new Tag Rule using the fields of the alert. With this operation, you can define the specific fields needed to automatically tag similar alerts in the future. By default, you’ll have the “False Positive” tag available for use. Creating Filters from an Alert . The Alert Management Module also provides an intuitive feature to generate a filter based on the specific attributes of an alert. This feature can be particularly helpful when investigating a series of related alerts or when you wish to monitor alerts with similar characteristics. To utilize this feature, simply select the alert that exhibits the characteristics you wish to filter by. Then, choose the filter icon from Alert’ s option. Adding Notes to an Alert . To enhance collaboration and knowledge sharing, you can add notes to each alert. This operation enables you to annotate an alert with relevant observations, questions, or insights, providing valuable context for you and your team. ",

The report can be tailored based on a specific timeframe within the last 7 days and the quantity of alerts to be included in the report. The quantity can be predefined as 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, or 2500 alerts per report, depending on your requirements. Manage Tags . This function provides the ability to manage and customize the tags available in your system. Tags can be incredibly useful for categorizing and filtering your alerts. You can create new tags or manage existing ones to ensure they align with your alert handling workflow. View Tag Rules . Finally, the ‘View Tag Rules’ option allows you to review and manage your established tag rules. In this section, you can inspect the details of each rule or delete them if they’re no longer required. Tag rules assist in automating the process of alert tagging based on specific conditions or criteria. ",

    "content": ". The UTMStack master and proxy deployment model offers optimal flexibility and security, making it suitable for Managed Services Providers (MSPs) looking to host UTMStack within their network. By deploying UTMStack within their infrastructure, MSPs gain complete control over their network and data. Lightweight proxy servers are then installed within each customer’s network, functioning as local master servers. These proxies serve as intermediaries, securely collecting logs from customer devices and forwarding them to the central master server. This deployment model is particularly useful when capturing and transmitting logs from customer firewall devices. Instead of sending logs directly over the internet, which may not be recommended for security reasons, the Probe proxy acts as a secure intermediary. It captures the logs locally within the customer’s network and securely transmits them to the Master Server over the internet. By implementing the UTMStack master and proxy model, MSPs can ensure the secure and efficient collection of logs from customer networks, enabling effective monitoring and analysis while maintaining a high level of data protection and privacy. IMPORTANT NOTE: . Please note that a proxy is not always required. UTMstack supports SysLog TLS and all communications between agents and master servers are encrypted using TLS. The proxy is recommended only if customer servers are not allowed to access the internet or there are devices like old firewalls that do not support TLS encryption over the internet. Agents can be installed in customer servers directly without needing a proxy. Devices that support Syslog TLS can send logs directly to UTMStack. ",

Step 1: Select Metric Aggregation You’ll start with defining your metric aggregation. For this case, you’re counting the number of alerts in each category, so select the ‘Count’ aggregation. Step 2: Configure Bucket Aggregation Next, define your bucket aggregation. Here, you will use the ‘Terms’ aggregation on the ‘alert.category.keyword’ field. This organizes your alerts data into different categories. Step 3: Adjust Scale and Color Range Now it’s time to choose a suitable color scale. For clarity, you might want to use a ‘Sequential’ color scale, which assigns cooler colors to lower alert counts and warmer colors to higher alert counts. Remember, the goal is to allow for easy visual differentiation between high and low incident counts. Step 5: Generate Your Visualization After all these settings are done, click on ‘Run’. This will generate your Heat Map, where you can identify the most frequent incident categories in your alert index at a glance. By using this Heat Map, you can promptly pinpoint which categories of alerts are more common, enabling you to focus your resources and attention more effectively. ",

    "title": "Log Explorer Module",
    "content": "The Log Explorer Module, a central element of UTMStack, is purpose-built to deliver an exhaustive and comprehensive view of an organization’s log data. This dynamic, highly interactive tool is engineered to provide real-time visibility into log data, allowing for immediate filtering and nuanced analysis. Its central role in the proactive monitoring and effective management of network activities is indispensable to a well-maintained cybersecurity infrastructure. Overview . The Log Explorer interface has been thoughtfully designed for seamless navigation and efficient functionality. The module’s centerpiece is the Data Grid, a feature offering an extensive view of an organization’s log data based on the defined datasource and query. This enables a logical grouping of queries based on user-defined filters, and the capacity to open multiple tabs for various queries. This level of customization empowers users to save their search criteria for future use, making the tool adaptable and time-efficient. In a concerted effort to make data analysis as user-friendly as possible, the Log Explorer module provides visually intuitive representations of logs. Interactive charts and graphs facilitate an at-a-glance understanding of data trends and patterns, simplifying the task of data interpretation. 1. Source . A key aspect of the Log Explorer module is the source functionality. Serving as a crucial data filtering tool, it lets users narrow down their search to specific index patterns. For instance, users can confine their search, for example, to logs originating from Office365 exclusively, thereby eliminating unnecessary data noise. In addition, this module offers the flexibility to create custom index patterns or sources. This allows users to define search parameters that cater to their specific needs, providing a level of personalization that ensures a more targeted and efficient search experience. 2. Filters . Serving as the backbone of the Log Explorer, the filtering functionality offers comprehensive data parsing based on the user’s search requirements. Filters can be defined to track logs from a specific computer, or to isolate logs pertaining to a specific operation, such as a log-in event. The versatility of these filters provides an unparalleled level of control over data analysis. The Log Explorer module simplifies filter creation by providing the option to add a filter based on a specific log field with a single click. This degree of simplicity ensures that users can focus more on the analysis and less on the process. 3. Data Grid . The Data Grid is where the bulk of log information can be viewed, offering users the choice of viewing the data in a table or chart format. This visualization is predicated on a selected field, allowing for a high degree of customization. Users can also define the columns they want to see in the Table mode view, either through the Select fields option on the left, or by directly selecting a field in the log. 4 The Log . The Log section offers a comprehensive view of all log information, ranging from agent_id, process name, to the source IP. This data can be viewed in two ways – either in a table view or in a JSON mode – depending on the user’s preference. The Table mode offers the added benefit of allowing the user to add filters based on the field and value of a specific log, or to create a column in the Data Grid table based on a specific field. 4.1 Options . Each log field within the Log Explorer module provides two key options for users: . | Adding a filter: Based on the field and value of a specific log, users can swiftly add a filter. This feature further fine-tunes the data presented in the Data Grid, refining the log data to fit the user’s specific needs. | Creating a column: Users can choose to create a new column in the Data Grid Table based on the field. This feature allows for immediate visibility and accessibility of key data points. | . 5. Personalize Fields . You can also add or remove columns in the Data Grid view, based on the fields of the logs. 5. Save the information . Users can refresh their data, save the current query for future use, or export the current data to a CSV file for offline analysis. For example, a filter to view all Office365 log-in activities could be saved for future use, negating the need to repeat the filter creation process. The option to view and manage stored queries also ensures that past investigations can be revisited with ease. By offering these customizable options, the Log Explorer module delivers an adaptable interface that caters to the specific requirements of individual users. Whether it’s streamlining data analysis by focusing on certain values or enhancing visibility of crucial data, these options ensure a more efficient and tailored log exploration experience.

    "content": ". By default, UTMStack generates a generalized visualization based on the chosen aggregation metric (Count) and the selected chart type. Users can further refine this data using specific aggregation buckets. For an in-depth understanding of metric aggregations and bucket aggregations associated with each chart type, please refer to the respective chart’s documentation section. Applying Filters to Visualizations . One of the critical steps in creating a visualization is filtering the data you want to display. This involves comparing a specific field with a selected value using an operator. For instance, suppose you want to create a visualization focusing on Office 365 logon failures. In this case, select the field logx.o365.ResultStatus.keyword and apply the IS operator to check for equality to the value Failure.This filter will limit the visualization to the unsuccessful login attempts in Office 365. Understanding Filter Operators . Filter operators in UTMStack help fine-tune data selection within visualizations. Here are the available operators and their functionalities: . | Is: This operator selects all data entries matching the specific value chosen. | Is Not: Contrary to ‘Is’, this operator selects all data entries that do not match the specific value chosen. | Is One Of: This operator selects all data entries that match any value from a set of values specified. | Is Not One Of: This operator selects all data entries that do not match any value from a set of values specified. | Exists: This operator selects all data entries where the specified field exists. | Does Not Exist: This operator selects all data entries where the specified field does not exist. | Is Between: This operator selects numeric data within a specific value range. The range must align with the input pattern for each data field. For instance, the pattern for @timestamp is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM: SS.MsMsMsZ (2021-12-12T02:30:00.000Z.) . | Is Not Between: This operator selects numeric data not within a specific value range. | Contains: This operator selects all data entries containing a specific string. | Does Not Contain: This operator selects all data entries that do not contain a specific string. | Starts With: This operator selects all data entries that start with a specific string. | Does Not Start With: This operator selects all data entries that do not start with a specific string. | Ends With: This operator selects all data entries that end with a specific string. | Does Not End With: This operator selects all data entries that do not end with a specific string. | . The applied filters appear at the top of the interface, where they can be edited, deleted, or reverted as needed. Having selected your chart type and set up your filters, the next step involves adjusting specific parameters to your chosen chart type. For detailed instructions on how to proceed with each type of chart, please refer to the respective sections Chart Types. ",

    "title": "Configuring Metric and Bucket Aggregations for Charts",
    "content": "In UTMStack, crafting the right visualization involves the careful selection and application of metric and bucket aggregations. These play a pivotal role in determining how your data is analyzed and presented. | Metric Aggregation Choose the right metric aggregations for your chart. UTMStack offers several aggregations options: | . | Count: Returns a raw count of the elements in the selected index pattern. | Average: Returns the average of a numeric field. You’ll need to select the appropriate field from the drop-down. | Sum: Returns the total sum of a numeric field. Choose the relevant field from the drop-down. | Min: Returns the minimum value of a numeric field. Select the corresponding field from the drop-down. | Max: Returns the maximum value of a numeric field. Choose the appropriate field from the drop-down. | Unique Count: Returns the number of unique values in a field (cardinality aggregation). Select the relevant field from the drop-down. | . For each aggregation, you can change the default display label by entering a custom string in the “Custom Label” field. The Add Metrics button and the red cross symbol allow you to add or remove aggregations as per your needs. | Bucket Aggregation Bucket aggregation serves to categorize data based on specific criteria, enabling meaningful insights. The two bucket aggregation types in UTMStack are: | . | Date Histogram: This type constructs a date-wise distribution based on a numeric field. Here, you need to pick a field representing the timeline and stipulate a minimum time frame (options include minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly) in the Minimum intervals. For a custom interval frame, select the Custom interval option and specify a time unit. Time units can be milliseconds (ms), seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h), or days (d). The Custom Label field allows you to modify the display label. | Terms Terms bucket aggregation categorizes data into buckets based on distinct values present in a specified field. These buckets are dynamically generated, each corresponding to a term found in the data field. This approach is beneficial when you want to analyze and visualize data with distinct or categorical values. | . Here’s how you can configure the Terms bucket aggregation in UTMStack: . | Field: Choose the field from which the terms for the buckets will be derived. This field will be the basis for categorizing the data into different buckets. | Order By: Decide how the buckets should be ordered. You can order them based on a metric (e.g., count, sum, average, min, max, etc.) or alphabetically (by term). The bucket with the highest value in the selected metric or alphabetical term will be presented first, depending on your chosen sort direction. | Order: Define the sort direction of the buckets. You can sort the buckets in either ascending or descending order. | Size: Specify the number of terms/buckets that should be returned per page. | Custom Label: If you want to change the default label for the buckets, enter your desired text in the Custom Label field. | .
