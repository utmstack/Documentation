# Components

The ecosystem is built on a two-tier architecture: the high-performance **EventProcessor** engine (managed core) and the **UTMStack** extension layer (open-source ecosystem).

## **EventProcessor (Managed Core)**

The EventProcessor is the proprietary, high-performance engine that orchestrates the data pipeline. While the core engine repository is private, its functionality is fully extensible through the public SDK and the custom plugin system.

### **Parsing Plugins (Built-in)**

Atomic steps used in filters to structure data.

- **Data Extraction: **********`json`**********, **********`kv`**********, **********`csv`**********, **********`grok`**********.**
- **Transformation: **********`rename`**********, **********`cast`**********, **********`reformat`**********, **********`trim`**********, **********`add`**********.**
- **Control: **********`delete`**********, **********`drop`**********.**

### **Analysis Engines**

- **cel**: The primary engine for evaluating <u>[Rules](https://github.com/utmstack/UTMStack/wiki/Implementing-Rules)</u> using Common Expression Language.
- **feeds**: A threat intelligence engine that correlates logs with ThreatWinds malicious indicators (IPs, Domains, Hashes).

## **UTMStack (Open Source Ecosystem)**

UTMStack provides the open-source layer of specialized plugins and integrations. We welcome community contributions in the

| Category | Plugin(s) | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Ingestion | inputs | Unified entry point for logs via HTTP and gRPC (Agents, Syslog-ng). |
| Integrations | aws, azure, gcp, o365, crowdstrike, sophos, bitdefender | Native cloud and EDR collectors. |
| Parsing | geolocation | Enriches events with geographic context. |
| Output / Storage | events | Indexes all successfully processed events into OpenSearch (using the v11-log-* pattern). |
| Correlation / Lifecycle | alerts | Handles alert deduplication, parent-child linking, and indexing into the v11-alert index. |
| Notification | stats | System metrics and internal health reports. |
| Management | config | Centralized configuration service. |

## **Architecture & Extensibility**

### **Orchestration**

> [!NOTE]
> The engine manages adaptive queues and worker pools to ensure high-speed ingestion and processing. It enforces the <u>[Standard Event Schema](https://github.com/utmstack/UTMStack/wiki/Standard-Event-Schema)</u> across all components.

### **The Public go-sdk**

Every component—both built-in and community-contributed—interfaces with the system via the Open Source <u>[go-sdk](https://github.com/threatwinds/go-sdk)</u>.

- **Type Safety**: Common definitions for Logs, Events, and Alerts.
- **Connectivity**: gRPC service definitions for Parsing, Analysis, and Correlation.
- **Development**: Hot-reloading support for custom plugins.
