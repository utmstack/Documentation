# Standard Event Schema

To ensure consistency and allow rules to work across different data sources, the EventProcessor uses a standardized event schema. All filters should aim to map extracted data to these standard fields.

## **Event Structure**

> [!NOTE]
> The core event object consists of several top-level metadata fields and three main namespaces: `log`, `origin`, and `target`.
